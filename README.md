This project was made for a CS1116 assignment. It consists of a simple 2D car game with semi-realistic physics for the movement of the user-controlled entity. It is called Octane Odyssey. The project features a login/account system, email verification, a leaderboard and the game itself. The game is coded in Javascript and the surrounding features (serverside) are written in Python.

Some parts have been hardcoded as university server specific and redacted to be defined in hidden variables. Ideally these should be environment variables if I were to continue work on this project.
